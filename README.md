### Typical Gantt Chart:
 * **Help with designing the robot (Kickoff - end of W1)**  
 You can't code a robot that doesn't exist!
 * **Boilerplate Code (W1 - W2)**  
  This refers to code that is obvious, not just getters/setters.
 * **Helping with field elements (W1 - W4)**  
 In the absence of programming work, please help the mechanical team with putting together field elements so we can test the robot in a reasonable amount of time.
 * **Testing robot mechanisms (W2 - W6)**  
 As various parts of the robot get finished, try and test things with code. This does not require an electrical board, just put the base on 2x4s and make sure wheels spin, or hook up the intake, etc. This is a bit tougher, and requires good time management and communication.
 * **Writing autonomous routines (W2 - W8)**  
 This should be split between programmers, and programmers who build field elements. Everyone can collaborate and contribute, of course. Having more ideas is better. Styling our autonomous is going to be a challenge.
 * **Testing the robot (W6 - W8)**  
 Yes, this implies the robot is done by week 6, but hopefully it is!
